# Stock-Market-Analysis
Two of India's biggest stock exchanges BSE and NSE, collectively clear trades combining to greater than 40,000 crores every day. As you might already be aware, a lot of trading happens on the basis of technical and fundamental analysis.     One of the most basic technical analysis used by a lot of stock traders is the Moving Average Method.For the purpose of this project, we will be using 20 day and 50 day moving averages.
When the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average, it is a signal to BUY, as it indicates that the trend is shifting up. This is known as a Golden Cross.
On the opposite when the shorter term moving average crosses below the longer term moving average, it is a signal to SELL, as it indicates the trend is shifting down. It is sometimes referred to as the Death Cross.
When the signal is neither buy nor sell, it is classified as hold. If you already own the stock, keep it and if you don't then don't buy it now.
